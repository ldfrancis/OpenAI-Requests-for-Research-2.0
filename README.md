# OpenAI-Requests-for-Research-2.0
This repository will contain my implementations of solutions to the challenges described in the openAI's request for research 2.0

## Warmups
I've resolved to attempt the warm-up exercises. These exercises, although, having been solved, would serve as a stepping stone into solving the more complex challenges as they would provide some moral support to annihilate the difficulties the implementer would encounter while struggling with the more difficult challenges.

- [ ] XOR_LSTM: ⭐

The aim of this challenge is to train an LSTM to solve the XOR problem. This problem involves determining the parity of a sequence of bits. 2 approaches are to be tested.
1. train the LSTM on a generated dataset of random 100,000 binary strings of length 50 and check the performance.
2. train the LSTM on a generated dataset of random 100,000 binary strings with a randomly chosen length between 1 and 50 and check its performance.


- [ ] CLASSIC_SNAKE: ⭐

In this challenge, one is to come up with an implementation of the classic snake game as a Gym environment and then solve the environment using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
